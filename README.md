# Portfolio

## A web site build in Next.js that introduce myself and shows a little bit my experience as Front-end developer

This project is a quick introducing my life in private, in school and in software. In there I show also all my projects that I build so far not just in pure HTML and CSS but also in React, Next.js or in TailwindCSS. I mentioned about my front-end roadmap and where you can find me.
